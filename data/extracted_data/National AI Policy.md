Chapter One: Introduction 
 
1. Background 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer -based system or machine capable of 
learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and performing tasks autonomously, 
much like human beings. AI has been applied in diverse sectors such as education, 
health, finance, public services, industry, and security. In Nepal, the transformative 
potential of AI can help reduce the digital divide, enhance efficiency in public 
service delivery, improve the quality of e ducation, create employment 
opportunities, foster higher socio -economic development, and contribute to the 
achievement of sustainable development goals. 
In Nepal, significant efforts have been made toward the development, expansion, 
and regulation of infor mation technology through the enactment and 
implementation of the Electronic Transactions Act, 2006 (2063 B.S.) , the 
Information and Communication Technology Policy, 2015 (2072 B.S.), the Digital 
Nepal Framework, 2019 (2076 B.S.) , the National Science, Tec hnology and 
Innovation Policy, 2019 (2076 B.S.), and the National Cyber Security Policy, 2023 
(2080 B.S.). The Concept Paper on the Use and Practice of Artificial Intelligence 
in Nepal, issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, 
has also emphasized the need to formulate a National Artificial Intelligence Policy. 
As a result of these past policy initiatives, access to telecommunications services 
has expanded widely, the use of the internet has grown significantly, IT 
infrastructure has been developed, and the sector’s competitive capacity has been 
considerably enhanced. 
Globally, technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, predictive AI, and 
generative AI are being developed and applied across various sectors. In the 
context of Nepal, universities and private organizations have also been engaged in 
teaching, research, development, and application of systems such as chatbots,

natural language processing, and machine learning. In this regard, the formulation 
of a National Artif icial Intelligence (AI) Policy  is necessary for research, 
development, and utilization of AI by ensuring proper data management, building 
digital infrastructure, developing skilled human resources, promoting AI -based 
industries, and creating an ecosystem for safe and responsible use. 
 
2. Problems, Challenges, and the Need for Policy 
2.1 Problems and Challenges 
In the context of Nepal, several challenges exist in the field of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) like lack of data generation,  easy accessibility, and availability; 
the absence of adequate policy, legal, and institutional framework s for data 
security and privacy. Also , there are  insufficient infrastructure, standards, and 
skilled human resources for AI development and use; limited investment and 
regulatory mechanisms for IT industries, research institutions, and startups related 
to AI; as well as biased outcomes and privacy violations resulting from AI 
applications. 
Although research, development, and application of AI are advancing rapidly 
across the wo rld, in Nepal challenges persist in ensuring accountability and 
responsibility for risks arising from AI use, securing the availability of adequate 
datasets for AI development and application, and reducing dependency on external 
resources. Additional chall enges include managing the potential reduction of 
existing jobs due to AI adoption and addressing its impacts; ensuring the required 
investment, resources, and infrastructure for AI development and application; 
securing access to advanced technologies; pro tecting trademarks, patents, and 
intellectual property rights while preventing violations and misuse; and addressing 
issues such as misinformation, deepfakes, and personal biases arising from AI; and 
ensuring the ethical and human-Centered use of AI.

2.2 Need for Policy 
The need for this policy arises from the necessity of internalizing the fundamental 
principles of human -Centered and ethical AI, as guided by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and fostering the 
development and use of ethical, responsible, and transparent AI systems. Also, this 
policy is required to coordinate with national and international organizations 
related to AI; to produce skilled human resources in information technology; to 
create new employment opportunities through AI -based industries and startup; to 
prioritize AI-related research and development, and its application across diverse 
sectors; and the promotion of innovation to generate new opportunities. This policy 
is also necessary to address risks associated with AI, such as the spread of 
misinformation and deepfakes, job displacement and its social and economic 
consequences, and to establish mechanisms for regulation, identification and 
categorization of risks that can ar ise from the use of this technology, and its 
mitigation.  
Furthermore, this policy is necessary to promote good governance by integrating 
AI into existing information technology systems in Nepal, to enhance the quality, 
accessibility, and efficiency of pub lic service delivery across all three tiers of 
government in sectors such as agriculture, education, health, industry, finance, 
public services, and security. It is also required to ensure the creation, availability, 
and accessibility of data while maintaining privacy and security, to develop policy 
and structural mechanisms for building a robust data ecosystem, and ultimately to 
achieve comprehensive socio -economic development through the effective 
utilization of Artificial Intelligence.
